## Introduction

I am an enthusiastic software engineer who has _**almost**_ graduated from Makers Academy (an intensive 16 week full stack course).

I have always had a passionate interest in tech, having been an avid Nintendo fan from the age of 5, to discovering how to root and mod android phones in my early teenage years, and winding up in more recent times battling through Codewars Katas.

The Makers Course has shown me:

- The process of learning new technologies for each project is addicting.
- Finding and creating solutions with your team mates is insatiably satisfying.
- Seeing an app that you have created is incredibly exciting.

<br>

## Soft Skills

- Great team player and have the ability to help keep morale high during stressful projects.
- A fast and adaptable learner.
- Keen eye for detail and delight in problem solving, nothing feels better!
- Curious nature with a desire to always be learning new things.

- JavaScript, React, Jest, Node.js, Express
- Ruby, Rspec, Sinatra, Capybara
- HTML, CSS, Handlebars

_Assistant Adult Social Worker_

- I was within the Duty team which meant I was responsible for new cases or cases of colleagues who were not present. 
- Meet adults with either physical or learning disabilities at their home and carry out a full social care assessment to understand their needs, which were often complex i.e. were they able to wash/dress/eat independently. 
- Create support plans and when necessary liaise with other professionals such as care workers and occupational therapists. 
- After several weeks I would review the case and when I had successfully stabilised the situation, the case would be passed on to one of the long term teams. 
- Other important day to day tasks included monitoring our duty inbox and allocating cases to other team members, filling out vast amounts of paperwork and completing financial spreadsheets in relation to support plans accurately and quickly, taking calls from Spelthorne residents and responding to queries and concerns, assisting with safeguarding cases and attending young career events to provide advice and my contact details should they need any further support.
